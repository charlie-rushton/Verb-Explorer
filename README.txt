All source code can be found inside the folder called ‘Program Files’. There is an SQL script in the root directory that needs to be run to create the database schema and tables.

Instructions for Installation:
Step 1 - copy all files from Program Files folder to server where you wish to host game.

Step 2 - Run SQL script on server to create schema and create tables.

Step 3 - Edit PHP files on server which you have just copied from the Program Files to include you server information (IP address, username, password) and database schema name (default schema name: ‘VerbExplorer’).

Game should now run on server.
